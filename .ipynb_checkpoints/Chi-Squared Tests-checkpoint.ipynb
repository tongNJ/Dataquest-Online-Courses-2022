    "- The entire dataset has <font color='red'>32,561</font> rows, and is a sample of the full census. Of the rows, <font color='red'>10,771</font> are Female, and <font color='red'>21,790</font> are Male. These numbers may seem incorrect, because the full census shows that the U.S. is about <font color='red'>50%</font> Male and <font color='red'>50%</font> Female. Therefore, our expected values for number of Males and Females would be <font color='red'>16,280.5</font> each.\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that the numbers may seem incorrect, but we don't quite know how to find the numerical value for the observed and expected values. We also can't determine if there's a statistically significant difference between the two groups, and if we need to examine further.\n",
