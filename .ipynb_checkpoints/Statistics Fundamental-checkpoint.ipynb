    "# Statistics Fundamentals\n",
    "Here are a couple of takeaways you can expect by the end of this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "- How population and sampels work\n",
    "- Various sampling methods you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the workflow we'll begin working with in this lesson\n",

    "\n",
    "In statistics, we call the set of all individuals relevant to a particular statistical question a **population**. \n",
    "We call a smaller group selected from a population a **sample**. When we select a smaller group from a population we're **sampling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "Now it's our turn to play the data analyst. We collected data about the salaries of all the individuals in the company working in IT roles. Based on this data, we want to answer a series of questions. Depending on the question, our data is either a sample or a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify which is the case, and assign to the corresponding variable the string 'population' or 'sample'. Here are the questions we need to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What's the average salary of the individuals in our company working in IT roles? **population**\n",
    "- What's the proportion of individuals in the IT department having salaries under 60000? **population**\n",
    "- What's the minimum salary in the entire company? **sample**\n",
    "- What's the minimum salary in the IT department of our company? **population**\n",
    "- What's the proportion of salaries under 20000 in the entire company? **sample**\n",
    "\n",
    "For every statistical question we want to answer, we should try to use the population. In practice, that's not always possible because the populations of interest usually vary from large to extremely large. Also, getting data is generally not an easy task, so small populations often pose problems too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve these problems by sampling from the population that interests us. Although it's not as good as working with the entire population, working with a sample is the next best thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "or this reason, there's almost always some difference between the metrics of a population and the metrics of a sample. We can see this difference as an error, and because it's the result of sampling, we call it **sampling error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical terms, we want our samples to be **representative** of their corresponding populations. If a sample is representative, then the sampling error is low. The more representative a sample is, the smaller the sampling error. The less representative a sample is, the greater the sampling error.\n"

    "### A real data set we use for sampling lesson\n",
    "At this point in the lesson, we'll move from the tech company example to working with a real-world dataset. Our first challenge will be to measure sampling error using this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is about basketball players in the **WNBA** (Women's National Basketball Association), and contains general information about players, along with their metrics for the 2016-2017 season. **Thomas De Jonghe** assembled this dataset, and you can download it from **Kaggle** (where you can also find useful documentation for the dataset)."
