    "- What is the probability of cracking a 4-digit PIN code using the code 8362?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of cracking a 6-digit PIN code using the code 348821?\n",

Because order matters, the code 1289 is different than the code 9821, even though both are composed of the same four digits: 1, 2, 8 and 9. If the order of digits didn't matter, 1289 would be the same as 9821.\n",
